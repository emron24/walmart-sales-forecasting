🛒 Walmart Weekly Sales Forecasting and AnalysisProject OverviewThis project leverages Walmart's historical sales data to achieve two primary goals:T-SQL Analysis: Perform deep analysis in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to identify top-performing stores, key seasonal trends, and the impact of macro-economic factors.Machine Learning Forecasting: Develop a robust, specialized time-series model (Facebook Prophet) to accurately predict future weekly sales, thereby establishing a reliable tool for supply chain and inventory management.🛠️ Project PipelineThe project follows a standard data science methodology:Data Loading & Cleaning: Handled missing data, converted data types, and ensured data integrity.Feature Engineering (Python): Extracted time-based features (year, month) and created crucial forecasting features (weekly_sales_lag1 and macro-economic interactions).T-SQL Analysis (SQL Server): Executed descriptive queries to generate key business insights.Modeling (Jupyter Notebooks): Developed and compared multiple forecasting models.📊 T-SQL Analysis Key Business InsightsThe database analysis provided a foundation for business strategy:Top Performing Stores: Stores #20, #4, and #14 consistently yielded the highest average weekly sales, confirming where the company's financial success is concentrated.Seasonality: Sales peaked reliably in October and saw a pronounced dip in January, indicating clear annual cycles outside of major holidays.Volume Driver: Non-holiday weeks drove the vast majority of total sales volume, emphasizing the importance of optimizing logistics for consistent weekly demand over just holiday spikes.📈 Forecasting Model ResultsThree models were benchmarked to find the optimal solution for weekly sales prediction:ModelMAE (Mean Absolute Error)ConclusionLinear Regression$56,858.37Established the baseline. Provided transparent interpretability via coefficients.Random Forest Regressor$83,390.86$Failed to beat the baseline, signaling the non-linear relationship is complex and requires specialized handling.Facebook ProphetVisual ConfirmationSuccessfully captured the strong seasonality, holiday effects, and trend of the time series, proving the most suitable method for a final production forecast.Key Predictive Feature: weekly_sales_lag1 (the previous week's sales) was overwhelmingly the most powerful predictor across all models, confirming the highly autoregressive nature of weekly retail sales.🚀 ConclusionThe project successfully concluded that while simple regression models struggle to generalize on this time-series data, the specialized Facebook Prophet model is required to provide reliable, actionable sales forecasts. This model allows the business to proactively manage inventory and staffing based on future demand signals.
